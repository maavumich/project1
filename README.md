# Training Project 1
To clone this project, run the command:

	git clone https://github.com/maavumich/project1

This project will put to use the skills you learned in project 0 as well as allow you to develop new
skills in C++. You will also learn to work with a preexisting codebase. This latter skill is
important since you will be working with the MAAV codebase following the completion of these
projects.

There also exist several reference sheets that you fill find useful throughout these projects.

You will need several dependencies to compile your project. They will all be installed by a script
found in the `scripts` directory. To run the install script, type the following into your terminal
from this direcotry (not from the scripts directory):

	./scripts/install-deps.sh

Or you can just install the dependencies manually by typing this into your terminal window:

	sudo apt-get install libgtkmm-3.0-dev libepoxy-dev libglm-dev cmake

This works on Ubuntu based operating systems. You will have to use the correct package installer for
your distro.

Please refer to the style guide that comes with this project if you have any questions about coding
style. While we encourage you to use MAAV coding style in this project, we do not require it. You
will be expected to adhere to the style guide when you contribute to the MAAV codebase so you will
need to learn it eventually. May as well start now if you can.
