# Training Project 1
To clone this project, run the command:

		git clone https://github.com/maavumich/project1

This project will put to use the skills you learned in project 0 as well as allow you to develop new
skills in C++. You will also learn to work with a preexisting codebase. This latter skill is
important since you will be working with the MAAV codebase following the completion of these
projects.

Please refer to the style guide that comes with this project if you have any questions about coding
style. While we encourage you to use MAAV coding style in this project, we do not require it. You
will be expected to adhere to the style guide when you contribute to the MAAV codebase so you will
need to learn it eventually. May as well start now if you can.
